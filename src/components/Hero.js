          My software development journey began in 2019 with a position at the
          fintech startup Fundamental Interactions. There I consulted with
          clients and collaborated with talented designers and brilliant
          managers to create digital products for both business and consumer
          use.

          Most recently I've worked at Tactacam, a company that specializes in
          wireless cameras for hunting and outdoor activities, as well as
          security, bird watching, and pest control.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my time at Tactacam I acted as the primary front-end developer
          on the Admin Panel system, a mission-critical platform used by agents
          to manage user accounts and cameras. I led the development of key
          features, including a CSR upsell marketplace and a mass notification
          system for user-wide messaging, and acted as the lead liaison between
          the front-end team and the UI/UX design team,ensuring seamless
          integration of design updates and user experience improvements.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also contributed to the development of user-facing web and mobile
          apps for their two most popular product lines: REVEAL and DEFEND,
          enabling users to manage and access cameras associated with those
          systems.
