          My software development journey began in 2019 with a position at the
          fintech startup Fundamental Interactions. There I consulted with
          clients and collaborated with talented designers and brilliant
          managers to create digital products for both business and consumer
          use.

          Most recently I've worked at Farther, a wealth management company.
          There I developed the frontend for their new Open Accounts system,
          which allows advisors to quickly and easily manage large financial
          plans and all of their associated accounts, clients, beneficiaries and
          documents.
